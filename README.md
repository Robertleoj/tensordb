# TensorDB

TensorDB is a lightweight local database for storing and querying tensors.


## Overview

You can create a database, and collections in that database. 

Collections have both basic data fields, and tensor fields, with a mandatory constraint on the data type, and optional constraints on dimensions and shapes. 

You can insert data into the database, and query it using the simple python API.

All data is stored locally, and the database is designed to be lightweight and fast.
